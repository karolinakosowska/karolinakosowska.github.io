This program is designed to perform operations on graphs.
Graphs are represented by an adjacency matrix.

You can:
- create a graph - directed or undirected, 
- load graph from file,
- add vertices and edges, 
- remove edges and all connections with vertices
- specify and modify edge weight,
- check number of vertices and edges, 
- check if a specific vertex/edge exists,
- display graph adjacency matrix,
- display vertices, edges, adjacency vertices and outgoing/incoming edges,
- display transposed graph,
- display graph complement,
- display vertices in DFS and BFS order,
- save graph to file.

After starting, a menu is displayed which is operated by entering the option number and confirming it with the "Enter" button.
If more than one number is required, they should be separated by a space.

Run `python3 main.py` from the shell.
